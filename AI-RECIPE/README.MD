# AI Recipe Generator

This project is an AI-powered recipe generator that creates easy-to-follow recipes based on user instructions. The application is built with modern web technologies and leverages an AI API to generate the recipes.

#### Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the web page, including the use of Google Fonts.
- **JavaScript**: For the interactive functionality, including form handling and API requests.
- **Typewriter.js**: For animating the display of the generated recipe.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the SheCodes AI API.
- **SheCodes AI API**: For generating the recipes based on user input.
- **Netlify**: For hosting the project.
- **GitHub**: For version control and code hosting.

#### Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- **src/styles.css**: The CSS file for styling the web page.
- **src/script.js**: The JavaScript file that handles the form submission, API requests, and displaying the generated recipes.

#### Features

- **User Instructions Input**: Users can input their desired recipe instructions (e.g., "Cake", "Cookies").
- **Recipe Generation**: The app sends the user instructions to the SheCodes AI API, which generates a recipe in basic HTML.
- **Animated Display**: The generated recipe is displayed on the web page with a typewriter animation effect.
- **Responsive Design**: The web page is designed to be responsive and works well on various devices.

#### How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user enters the type of recipe they want in an input field and submits the form.
2. **API Request**: The app sends a request to the SheCodes AI API with the user instructions and context.
3. **Recipe Display**: The response from the API is displayed on the web page with a typewriter animation.
